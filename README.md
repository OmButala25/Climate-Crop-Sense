# Climate-Crop-Sense
Climate crop sense is an predictive analytical model for climate resilience. Here we retrieve real-time data for accurate weather predictions for any particular district, enabling farmers to plan and adapt to changing climate conditions. Here in this project we do recommend an crop by user input about soil details with current weather information.
